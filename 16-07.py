#Control Statements => used for controlling the flow of execution of the code there are 3 types:
# 1) Conditional Statements: The conditional statements are used to execeute the task by satisfying the condition types are if, elif, else
#    Simple if => whenever we have one condition or one task to do that we use simple if
# 2) Looping statements: while, for
# 3) Jumping Statements: break, continue, pass


#Conditional Statements:-

#num = int(input())
#if num > 40 and num % 7==0:
#    print(f'{num} power is {num**2}')

#list1 = [1, 3, 5,'teju', 'debug', 'python']
#num = input("Enter a number that are present in the list:")
#if num in list1:
#    print("It is present")

#if-else => whenever we have one condition two different tasks

#num=int(input("Enter a number that we want to check wheather is it even or not:"))
#if num%2==0:
#    print(f"{num} is a even number")
#else:
#    print(f"{num} is a odd number")

#age = int(input("Enter your age please:"))
#if age>=18:
#   print("You can vote now")
#else:
#    print("Sorry, you're not eligible to vote")

#a = int(input("age1:"))
#b = int(input("age2:"))
#c = int(input("age3:"))
#if a>=b and a>=c:
#    large=a
#    print(f'{large} a')
#elif b>=a and b>=c:
#    large=b
#    print(large)
#else:
#    large=c
#    print(large)

#num1 = int(input("Enter num1:"))
#num2 = int(input("Enter num2:"))
#user = input("Enter what are the calculations that you are performed 1=Addition, 2=Subtraction, 3=Multiplication, 4=division")
#if user==1 or '+':
#    print(num1+num2)
#elif user==2 or '-':
#    print(num1-num2)
#elif user==3 or '*':
#    print(num1*num2)
#elif user==4 or '/':
#    print(num1/num2)
#else:
#    print("Please enter a valid operation..!")


#num5 = int(input("Enter a number you want to check:"))
#if num5%2==0:
#    print("Even")
#else:
